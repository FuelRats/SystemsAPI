Add statistics for database, updated hourly through eddn_client.

1.0.1
---
Implement Semver versioning and reporting from this point forward.


1.0a

This is a reimplementation of the original EDSM/EDDB JSONAPI, due to certain problems with
  outdated scaffolds used in PyCharm leaving cruft in the inner workings, and the original
  EDDB/EDSM implementations leaving much to be desired.

Most functionality remains the same, as do the returns, though some things are worth noting:

- Levenshtein search is no longer available. The search type is still supported, but uses built-
  in Postgres similarity search, not Levenshtein. Distance returned is a similarity float.
- InitializeDB no longer loads data to Postgres. ODO is no longer maintained and does not work
  properly with newer versions of Python (psycopg2 in particular). InitializeDB downloads the
  required CSV files and prepares them for injection using psql COPY.
- Relations are once more available on the JSONAPI endpoints.
- All objects are now keyed to id64. Previous implementations used EDSM or EDDB's IDs, which
  were not consistent. This version relies solely on id64.
- An EDDN client now keeps the systems and stars up to date, making the need to pull down complete
  dumps of the DB more of a one-time affair.
